        <center><h1>Cancellation and Refund Policy</h1></center><br><br>

<h3>AHIT&#39;s Right to Cancel Services</h3><br>

<p>All Hind Info-Tech aka AHIT, preserves the right to discontinue services in certain instances to maintain ethical, legal, and operational standards. The judgment we make is entirely subjective and based on what's best for all parties concerned. Please read the following conditions.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li>1. Non-compliance with AHIT&#39;s rules and guidelines for using the service or product.</li>
	<li>2. Failure to adhere to the agreement made for the project.</li>
	<li>3. Changes in laws or rules that significantly impact our ability to provide the service.</li>
	<li>4. The client&#39;s behaviour jeopardizes the security and functioning of AHIT&#39;s systems or services.</li>
	<li>5. The client&#39;s failure to deliver the required project information on time.</li>
	<li>6. If we come across any dishonest or fraudulent activity when placing a purchase or starting a service.</li>
	<li>7. We reserve the right to terminate the services if you fail to make the agreed-upon payments on time.</li>
</ol><br>

<h3>Refund Conditions: Eligible for Refund</h3>

<ol>
	<li>1. If you cancel the service before we start working on it, we&#39;ll give you a full refund.</li>
	<li>2. If the service has started but isn&#39;t finished yet, you can cancel it. We&#39;ll refund the service fee after deducting any charges already paid once we stop the service.</li>
	<li>3. Refunds will be given for transactions that didn&#39;t work or if your account was charged twice.</li>
	<li>4. If you had to pay any bank or card fees because of a cancelled service or a transaction that didn&#39;t work, we might refund those fees.</li>
	<li>5. If you cancel just part of the service, we&#39;ll figure out the right refund for that part.</li>
</ol><br>

<h3>Refund Conditions: Not Eligible for Refund</h3>

<ol>
	<li>1. Once the service is completed and delivered, cancellation is not possible.</li>
	<li>2. In the case of online data download options, cancellation is not possible once the download process starts.</li>
	<li>3. If the client fails to communicate a cancellation request within the stipulated timeframe.</li>
	<li>4. For services involving perishable or time-sensitive deliverables, cancellations may not be accepted once the process has commenced.</li>
	<li>5. Customized or tailored services/products with significant upfront costs may not be eligible for refunds, especially if work has begun.</li>
	<li>6. If the cancellation request lacks proper documentation or a valid reason for the cancellation.</li>
	<li>7. We can&#39;t guarantee exactly when the refund will show up in your account or how accurate it is.</li>
	<li>8. For ongoing support and service means that once your service is activated, refunds are not applicable.</li>
</ol><br>

<h3>Refund Process</h3>

<p>Refunds for eligible conditions will be processed within 4-5 working days. Once you request a refund, we&#39;ll carefully review the details and the process. If everything is verified and your request is eligible for a refund, we will continue with the refund after discussing it with you.</p>
<br>
<h3>Changes &amp; Updates</h3>

<p>We reserve the right to make modifications and enhancements to our policy. If we decide to do so, we will promptly notify you. We may make modifications to our cancellation policy from time to time. We want to keep you updated and make sure you are informed of any changes we make.</p>
